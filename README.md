# Deep Learning Framework for Social Interaction Analysis in Mice

## Overview
This project presents a comprehensive deep-learning framework designed to analyze social interactions among mice through video footage. Utilizing advanced machine learning techniques, including ResNet101 for both classification and regression tasks, our framework aims to identify and classify various social behaviors and anatomical key points to elucidate the complex dynamics of rodent interactions.

## Objective
The primary goal is to explore the relationship between the proximity of mice and their corresponding behaviors within a given frame, leveraging this understanding to enhance the accuracy of behavior classification and anatomical key point estimation in social interaction contexts.

## Methodology
Our approach involves a dual-model framework that integrates:
- **Social Behavior Analysis**: Classification of behaviors using ResNet101, optimized for recognizing distinct social interactions.
- **Anatomical Key Point Estimation**: Regression analysis to identify critical anatomical points, facilitating a deeper understanding of mice interactions through the proposed Mouse Action Recognition System (MARS).

## Model Evaluation
The framework's performance was rigorously evaluated using classification accuracy scores and mean squared error metrics, demonstrating its ability to accurately classify behaviors and estimate anatomical key points with moderate complexity.

## Results
Our findings reveal a significant correlation between mice proximity and their behaviors, validating the framework's capability to offer insights into social interactions. The classification model achieved optimal outcomes with moderate complexities, while the regression model presented challenges related to higher loss, attributable to its inherent nature.

## Conclusion
This study underscores the importance of analyzing social behavior and anatomical key points in mice, employing a dual ResNet 101 model framework. Despite the challenges, our approach demonstrates promising results in understanding the nuanced interactions of mice, contributing valuable insights to the field of behavioral science.
